# My First Remote Repo

This is my first remote repo. And now I am using it in AWS.


It started life as a local git repository.

But you'll be able to read this on GitHub when we put it onto a GitHub remote!
new change to this repo as I am learning how to push

This remote repo will now have another branch as I am learning how branches work locally and 
remote.

My name is Christian

Now I am making changes via the terminal using nano in order to test my understanding of things.
